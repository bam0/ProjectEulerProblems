# The First 100 Problems
## Project Euler with Python Programming

Through this series of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, I will be utilizing different techniques from python and mathematics to provide insight into how to solve some interesting programming challenges. For most problems, there is no 'best' approach. However, there are certainly better and worse ways to go about tackling them. For each problem I will try to offer at least a few different solutions, in order to compare different approaches and why some are more efficient than others. 

Hopefully this will be a helpful resource for anyone else interested in math or programming. By comparing between different implementations of the same basic programming concepts, we all gain a deeper understanding of our own code. 
Please feel free to offer feedback and I will be happy to fix my code or add some new information.

Let's all make the world of python devlopment a fun and engaging place by solving some problems!
